#  BBAte is an app that consumes the BestBuy API.

By Patrick Hughes

Originally written as a sample app for [Skip](https://github.com/GoSkip/iOS-Coding-Challenge), a prospective employer. The feedback I received was that "it did not pass our code review." They did not elaborate, but I was generally happy with it, and felt that it was better than should be expected for a 4 hour project, as they suggested. (It actually took me about twice that.)  ¯\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯
